# Redlang

learning to make interpreted programming language,

## HOW TO TOKENIZE

- use switch case for single character symbols and keywords
- use special function to parse keywords of language
- keep an index of line column and line number in scanLine
- use an error reporting interface

## Language Design

- Like Javascript
- Without
  - Type coercion (operations can only occur in same type)
  - this meaning what it should mean
  - Classes
  - switch with automatic break and fallthrough keyword
  - Block scoping and shouldn't be able to use variable before assignment
  - Standard Library
  -

## Things needed to do now

- Array primitives
- HashMap primitives
- Class and OOP support
- import/export support
- Math lib
- Fs lib
- Os lib
- UDP/TCP/HTTP lib
- Buffer

<!-- can be done later -->

- Crypto
- IO
- Time/Date
- timer
- zlib
